# Number Guessing Game

This is my first Python project, a simple Number Guessing Game where the player has to guess a randomly selected number by the computer within a certain range.

## How It Works:
- The computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - "It's a lower number" if the guess is too high.
  - "It's a higher number" if the guess is too low.
- The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
- The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.

## Features:
- Simple and easy-to-understand code.
- Great for beginners to understand loops, conditionals, and random number generation.
- Interactive user input and feedback.

Iâ€™m excited to share this project as my first step into Python programming. Feel free to download, modify, and experiment with the code!

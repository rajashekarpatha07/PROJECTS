## About
This repository is a collection of my early Python projects as I start my journey into programming. Each project is an opportunity to learn something new and build a solid foundation in Python.

Feel free to explore the projects, provide feedback, or contribute with suggestions or improvements. I'm excited to keep adding more projects as I learn and grow as a developer.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rajashekarpatha07/PROJECTS/blob/main/Number_guessing_game.py`
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the Python scripts with `python Number_guessing_game.py`.
